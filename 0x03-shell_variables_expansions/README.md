Scripts
script1 - This script does something important.
script2 - This script does something else important.
script3 - This script does yet another important thing.
Note that all scripts in this project have exactly two lines, start with #!/bin/bash, and end with a newline character. They have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and are executable. Additionally, we do not use the &&, ||, or ; operators, nor do we use the bc, sed, or awk utilities.
